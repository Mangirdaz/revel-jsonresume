# Welcome to Revel JSON Resume Example

## Getting Started

All this page is nothing more like simple implementation of revel framework. I used it as one of the first learning exercises with go. 


###conf

    The conf directory contains the applicationâ€™s configuration files. There are two main configuration files:

    * app.conf, the main configuration file for the application, which contains standard configuration parameters
    * routes, the routes definition file.
    * external config file can be placed in /usr/revel/cong/ and will be picked by app
    * json resume should be placed in /public/json/resume.json folder 
    * resume.json file location can be overwritten with config resume.path in app.conf file

### REVEL:

* The README file created within your application.
* The [Getting Started with Revel](http://revel.github.io/tutorial/index.html).
* The [Revel guides](http://revel.github.io/manual/index.html).
* The [Revel sample apps](http://revel.github.io/samples/index.html).
* The [API documentation](https://godoc.org/github.com/revel/revel).

### ToDo:
* Add Notes JSON. On form submit with my github password, read json from github repo, update it with new details and sumbit back to github.
* Page read nodes.json from gitbuh.com and load it
* Load resume.json from github.com too
